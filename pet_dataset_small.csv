83,83,Cat,4,Domestic Short Hair,Female,Black,White,Medium,Short,Yes,No,Healthy,0,"Charlie was rescued by dogs! A friend was walking his dogs when they suddenly became excited outside an apartment complex and sniffed out a shoe box. Inside the shoe box was little Charlie! He was about 6 weeks old then, emaciated and dehydrated, just a scrap of skin and bones. He had a bad tummy virus but survived it after two weeks of antibiotics. Now he needs a permanent home! Charlie is very active, playful, and affectionate. He likes playing with other cats and sitting on people's laps. He uses his litterbox without fail. Charlie is best suited for indoor living, free-roaming inside a house or apartment. Adoption Procedure: - We'll have a chat and see if you and Charlie are suitable for each other. Then you can meet and see if you get along :) - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter. I am primarily an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate occasional updates and photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and neutering at 6 months of age are COMPULSORY for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Look how Charlie started out! Please don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter. No cage confinement please, except in incidences of illness or injury. Imagine how bored, restless, and angry you'd be if you were locked up all the time. Prison is punishment! Interested parties can text or email me. An introduction of yourself, your experience with cats, and your approach to their care is greatly appreciated. Serious inquiries from responsible cat lovers only please. I want Charlie to be loved his whole life :)",5,2
84,84,Dog,120,Mixed Breed,Male,Black,Brown,Large,Short,Not Sure,Not Sure,Healthy,0,"I am posting this on my lecturer's behalf. She found this stray dog in her neighbourhood at Sungai Buloh. He was terrified of people but gradually warmed up to her after she fed him some food & he would wait outside her house at the same time every day for food. One day he didn't show up. When he finally showed up again, he had a large terrible wound on his neck. He was in so much pain and had tears in his eyes. She brought him to the vet and found out his wound had become infested with maggots. The vet treated him and she brought him home and nursed him back to health for over a month. The wound has now completely healed but unfortunately she is unable to keep him. He is estimated to be 10 years old but is still strong & healthy. We are unsure about his breed. He is very obedient & easy to care for. This precious angel has gone through a lot & really needs a loving home.",3,4

90,90,Dog,36,Rottweiler,Male,Black,Cream,Large,Short,Yes,Yes,Healthy,0,"I am looking for a loving permanent home for Kaiser. Kaiser is a really amazing, sweet and funny dog. He is very loving and affectionate, who loves and NEEDS attention. He needs someone that will treat him like part of the family and the sweet dog he is. He grew up with 2 cats and another small dog. he loves cats however it takes him awhile to respond well to new dogs. He never really socialized with children before, so if you have kids I would suggest meeting Kaiser with them before making a decision.He grew up mostly as an indoor dog but can do well outside if there is a shady place for him to relax during the hot parts of the day. NO Cage, No chain! please note that Kaiser is a family pet not guard dog. Kaiser is a pure breed rottweiler, he has his MKA certificate, basic dog obedience training certificate and a good citizens award metal. He also knows almost all the tricks: sit, stay, shake etc.and is a super fast learner. The reason I have to give him up for adaption is, Im an expat who was living in Malaysia for 5 years, I had to leave and unfortunately I was unable to take Kaiser with me (his breed was band in the country I moved to). I'm looking for someone to give him a permanent loving home. Kaiser is one of those dogs that crave that best friend relationship with his owner. so if you think he sounds like a good match for you please email me. my number is not available as I am out of the country, Kaiser is staying with my friend in Selangor for now.",4,2
